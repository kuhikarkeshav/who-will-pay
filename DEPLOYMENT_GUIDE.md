## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Error**: `Module not found`
```bash
# Solution: Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Error**: `Build exceeded time limit`
```bash
# Solution: Optimize build in netlify.toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = ".next"
  
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
```

### Site Not Loading

**Issue**: Blank page or 404 errors

**Solution**: Check `next.config.mjs`:
```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  output: 'standalone', // Important for Netlify
};
```

### Environment Variables

If you need environment variables:

1. Go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
2. Add your variables
3. Redeploy
