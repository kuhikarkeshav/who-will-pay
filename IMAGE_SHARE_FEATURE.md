## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack

**html2canvas** - Converts HTML to Canvas/Image
- Version: Latest
- High-quality rendering (2x scale)
- Transparent background support
- Cross-browser compatible

### Code Flow

```typescript
1. User clicks share button
   ↓
2. html2canvas captures winner card
   ↓
3. Canvas converted to PNG blob
   ↓
4. Create File object from blob
   ↓
5. Try Web Share API (mobile)
   ↓
6. If supported → Share image
   ↓
7. If not → Download image
```

### Implementation Details

<augment_code_snippet path="whoWillPay/app/components/WinnerCard.tsx" mode="EXCERPT">
````typescript
const handleShare = async () => {
  // Generate image from winner card
  const canvas = await html2canvas(cardRef.current, {
    backgroundColor: null,
    scale: 2, // High quality
    logging: false,
    useCORS: true,
  });

  // Convert to blob
  const blob = await new Promise<Blob>((resolve) => {
    canvas.toBlob((blob) => resolve(blob!), "image/png");
  });

  const file = new File([blob], "who-will-pay.png", { 
    type: "image/png" 
  });

  // Share via Web Share API or download
  if (navigator.canShare({ files: [file] })) {
    await navigator.share({
      files: [file],
      title: "Who Will Pay the Bill? 🍕",
      text: shareText,
    });
  } else {
    // Download fallback
    const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    const link = document.createElement("a");
    link.href = url;
    link.download = "who-will-pay.png";
    link.click();
  }
};
````

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Image is blank/black

**Cause**: CSS animations or external resources
**Solution**: 
- html2canvas captures static state
- Animations are frozen
- External images need CORS

### Issue: Share not working on mobile

**Cause**: Not using HTTPS
**Solution**:
- Web Share API requires HTTPS
- Test on deployed site (Netlify)
- localhost works for testing

### Issue: Image quality is low

**Cause**: Scale setting too low
**Solution**:
```typescript
scale: 2, // Increase to 3 or 4
```

### Issue: Download not working

**Cause**: Browser blocking downloads
**Solution**:
- Check browser permissions
- Allow downloads from site
- Try different browser

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Image Optimization

- Use PNG for quality
- Scale 2x is optimal (balance quality/size)
- Transparent background preserves design

### 2. Mobile Sharing

- Always test on real devices
- HTTPS is required
- Native share is better than clipboard

### 3. Desktop Experience

- Auto-download is intuitive
- Clear file naming
- Success feedback is important

### 4. Error Handling

- Always show feedback
- Allow retry on failure
- Don't block UI during generation

---

## 🚀 Performance

### Generation Time

- **Desktop**: ~500ms - 1s
- **Mobile**: ~1s - 2s
- **Depends on**: Card complexity, device speed

### File Size

- **Typical**: 100-300 KB
- **High quality**: 300-500 KB
- **Optimized**: < 100 KB (JPEG)

### Memory Usage

- Canvas created temporarily
- Blob released after share/download
- No memory leaks
